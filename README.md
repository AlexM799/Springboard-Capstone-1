This repository contains the project documents, data files and Jupyter notebooks for the Springboard Data Science Career Track Capstone 1 project.  The topic was predicting hypertension from health survey data using supervised classification machine learning algorithms.  All phases of the data science life cycle were included, as outlined in the project documents and summarized in the consolidated report.
